# Portfolio Two! (Repo - https://github.com/Carl-Lombardi/PortfolioTwo) (Site - https://carl-lombardi.github.io/PortfolioTwo/)
This is my second portfolio update. Included in it are links to Get Out (Team Project One), Karl's Travel Guide (Team Project Two), and New Jersey Devils Trivia 

## This site uses HTML, CSS, and links to sites using Bulma, Materialize, Javascript and JQuery 
The basic build of the site was HTML/CSS with links to sites using Materialize (Get Out!), Bulma (Karl's Travel Guide) and Javascript/JQuery (New Jersey Devils Trivia).

## Features
This portfolio differs from the first portfolio page. Instead of three pages, it has been condensed to one with multiple sections. There has also been a number of layout and font changes leading to a cleaner, more stylish apperence. There is updated biographical information, a portfolio section with three linked projects (GitHub and Site Links) and a contact section with GitHub and LinkedIn links. My Email address appears in the biographical section of the portfolio. 

## Installation 
No outside software is needed for installation. 

## How to Use
This is a pretty straight forward portfolio with all working links. 

## Issues and Solutions
There were not a lot of issues in creating the portfolio. The biggest issue was deciding on a clean layout with differing fonts. 

## Credits
This portfolio was created, written and developed by Carl Lombardi.
